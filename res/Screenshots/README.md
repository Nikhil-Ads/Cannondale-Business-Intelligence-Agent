# Screenshots

Place app screenshots here (e.g. for PRs or docs).

**Theme toggle (issue #4):** After running the app, open the sidebar and use the **Dark Mode** toggle to switch between light and dark themes. You can capture:
- `theme-light.png` — toggle off (default light theme)
- `theme-dark.png` — toggle on (dark theme)
